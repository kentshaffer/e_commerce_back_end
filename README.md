# (ORM) Back-End for E-Commerce site

## 13 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End

Used supplied starter code to complete the back end build for and e-commerce site using Node.js, Express.js, and Sequelize. Created and completed routes where necessary to get the seeded Express.js APIs up and functional. Sequelize was used to interact with the MySQL databases. Database connections were checked along the way using MySQL in the command line. Final connections were then checked between API databases, MySQL through Sequelize, and the browser, using Insomnia as a mock front end.

## About the author:

My name is Kent SHaffer and I am a student in UCSD's full stack web development bootcamp. Prior to starting the program I had zero code experience, so it feels I've been drinking in new information through a fire hose, but I have been learning more and more each day, and I'm excited about all the possibilities that live within the scope of the technologies I have been learning.

If you have any questions, or would like to get in contact, I can be reached at kentshaff@gmail.com
